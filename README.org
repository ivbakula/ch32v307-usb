* CH32v307 stuff

Here you can find some basic examples for CH32V307x MCU. CH32V307 is pretty cheap and capable chinese MCU based on QingKeV4 32-bit RISC-V core.
You can find more info about ch32v307x here https://github.com/openwch/ch32v307 and in ~doc~ directory. Currently, only official way to develop
and deploy software to ch32v307 MCU is via MounRiver IDE. This is proprietary development enviroment which can be downloaded from wch site. It 
is deployed along with cross compiler (gcc) and with OpenOCD which is used for flashing. The end goal of this project is to provide relatively
simple to use and more importantly really fast and small development framework (device drivers ...).
